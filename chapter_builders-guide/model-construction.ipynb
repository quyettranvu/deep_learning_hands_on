        "Then, once we started thinking about networks with multiple outputs,\n",
        "we leveraged vectorized arithmetic\n",
        "to characterize an entire layer of neurons.\n",

        "layers (i) take a set of inputs,\n",

        "a single layer was itself the model.\n",
        "However, even when we subsequently\n",
        "introduced MLPs,\n",
        "we could still think of the model as\n",
        "retaining this same basic structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, for MLPs,\n",
        "both the entire model and its constituent layers\n",
        "share this structure.\n",
        "The entire model takes in raw inputs (the features),\n",
        "generates outputs (the predictions),\n",
        "and possesses parameters\n",

        "generates outputs (the inputs to the subsequent layer),\n",

        "design patterns are common in practice.\n",
        "The ResNet architecture mentioned above\n",
        "won the 2015 ImageNet and COCO computer vision competitions\n",
        "for both recognition and detection :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016`\n",

        "Similar architectures in which layers are arranged\n",
        "in various repeating patterns\n",

        "including natural language processing and speech.\n",

        "To implement these complex networks,\n",

        "a component consisting of multiple layers,\n",
        "or the entire model itself!\n",
        "One benefit of working with the module abstraction\n",
        "is that they can be combined into larger artifacts,\n",
        "often recursively. This is illustrated in :numref:`fig_blocks`. By defining code to generate modules\n",
        "of arbitrary complexity on demand,\n",
